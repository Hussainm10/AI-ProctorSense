# AI-ProctorSense
ProctorSense is an AI-powered motion detection tool designed for educational institutions to enhance security during online exams, lab sessions, and restricted area monitoring.


 ProctorSense â€“ Motion Detection Tool for Educational Security

**ProctorSense** is a smart motion detection system designed specifically for inspection and security in educational environments. Leveraging computer vision and deep learning, ProctorSense can effectively detect suspicious or unauthorized motion during critical scenarios such as online examinations, lab sessions, and restricted access zones.

Project Overview

In today's digitally transforming educational sector, ensuring fairness and discipline during online and physical assessments has become more critical than ever. ProctorSense addresses this by acting as a virtual invigilator that monitors for motion-based anomalies and raises real-time alerts to flag them.
